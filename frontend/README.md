# Project Inspiration
Colleges are the place where we come to home mentioning about losing our new earphone which might have kept in a desk but not sure if it's still there. This problem feels so relatable to most of the college students. A problem will still remain the same until someone builds a solution to it.

# Features
* Get notified when a lost/found item is listed.
* "Response Validation" technique is used to prevent false claim and preventing misuse of information.
* Keep track of your listed items/response.
* Simple and Easy to use.


# Technolgies Used
* React JS (Frontend)
* Node JS, Express JS (Backend)
* MongoDB (Database)
